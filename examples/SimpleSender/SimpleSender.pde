/*
    SimpleSender
        
    This example demonstrates how to synchronize a variable from your Processing sketch
    to a variable on your arduino.
    In this case we synchronize the 'mouseX' and 'mouseY' variables already provided by
    Processing but you could easily synchronize your own variables in the same way.
   
    This example should be used together with the SimpleReceiver example of the Arduino
    version of the VSync Library
    ( https://github.com/ernestum/VSync )

  //  Tell the ValueSender what variables to synchronize from the arduino to the Processing sketch.
  //  Be careful to always use the same order as on the other side!
